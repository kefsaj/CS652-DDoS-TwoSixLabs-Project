DataSet used to run this script was taken from "Two Six Labs Internet Disruption Dataset" By Chae Clark. Due to space limitations, specifically "Indian Ocean Earthquake" taking 215 MB and "Italy Blackout" taking 188.8 MB were the only datasets used in this particular situation. Some issues were presented when using other datasets, and script could not be run.
